<hr>
<p>On the right is a list of all my projects, in order from most important to least. </p>
<p>So, <strong>if you&#39;re strapped for time, look at the first four</strong>, but really, they&#39;re all great!</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>I selected these projects as a nice representation of the kinds of things I&#39;ve been spending my free time on since I was in high school. </p>
<p>Everything here is also up for you to take a look at in as complete of a form as it exists right now. As with any software, development is never finished, so feel free to give me any feedback you have on the projects posted up here! </p>
<p><em>I can also verify that I provided significant contributions on everything here.</em></p>
<h3 id="this-website">This Website</h3>
<p>Not only are all of the projects off to the side my work, but this website is all my work as well. </p>
<p>Everything you see here is coded from scratch using solely HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. The only thing generated from tools was the html for the center content which was parsed from markdown. I decided to forgo some of the more powerful tools for web development in favor of doing things with just the basics because I feel that it provides the most opportunity for learning.</p>
