<p>Outside of school and work, I absolutely love to <strong>create</strong>.</p>
<p>Whether it&#39;s starting a new coding project to add to the mass of unfinished work on my hard drive, drawing a Montanan skyline, filling in a fictional world, or working to better the community, I&#39;ve always had a passion for dreaming up the impossible. </p>
<p>A lot of the things I try to create fall to the wayside along the way, so <em>why bother</em> you ask? I&#39;ll let a quote from one of my favorite books, <em>Cloud Atlas</em> speak for me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What is an ocean, but a multitude of drops?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m a big fan of trying to make a difference with the things that I create, and to have a great success, there must be unsuccessful stops along the way. So, I&#39;m off to build something big, hopefully something that can affect others.</p>
<p>While you&#39;re here, check out some things I enjoy other than Software Engineering.</p>

<h2 id="books-">Books.</h2>
<p>One of my favorite hobbies that I don&#39;t have enough time for, I&#39;m always looking for new books to read. </p>
<p>Right now I&#39;m nearing the end of <em>Gravity&#39;s Rainbow</em> by Thomas Pynchon, and if you want to check out some books I&#39;ve enjoyed or am planning on enjoying, head over to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11875896-garret" target="_blank">Goodreads</a></p>
<h2 id="board-games-">Board Games.</h2>
<p>There&#39;s no getting around it, I love games. There&#39;s just something wonderful about sitting around a table with friends, breaking out cards, boards, and dice for an evening of creative fun.</p>
<h5 id="interested-have-suggestions-">Interested? Have suggestions?</h5>
<p>I&#39;m always up for talking about games, from Magic to DnD, I&#39;ve seen plenty. Let me know what you think!</p>
<h2 id="volunteerism-and-charities-">Volunteerism and Charities.</h2>
<p>Even though I&#39;m busy getting through college, and affording it, I try to give what I can to important causes worldwide and locally. </p>
<p>I&#39;m heavily involved in <a href="http://hoby.org" target="_blank">Hugh O&#39;Brian Youth Leadership</a>, volunteering at their yearly seminar and putting in over 100 hours of other volunteer work throughout each year. Right now I&#39;m building a nice, new website for Montana Hoby and helping to plan next year&#39;s seminar. 
<strong>Let me know if you want to hear more.</strong></p>
<p>In addition to volunteering, I&#39;m trying to start a habit of donation this year. <em>I&#39;ll be donating money to a different charity each of the next 11 months.</em> If you have any suggestions for a cause important to you, I&#39;d love to hear about it and donate.</p>
