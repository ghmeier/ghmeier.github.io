<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>TravelQuest is a mobile app that hopes to encourage adventures. This game places the user as a character looking to complete quests and defeat monsters. Rather than being set in a fictional world though, TravelQuest ties every action to your geographical location. Every monster and quest is determined by your location. Rather than having generic objectives for fictional locations, the quests in TravelQuest might send you to the coffee shop down the street, or a famous landmark three hours away. </p>
<p>This mobile game hopes to make take advantage of a truly mobile platform.</p>
<p>I spent hundreds of hours working on this game throughout the summer. My main role was to handle everything that had to do with quests. This meant creating server architecture in C# to store information regarding each quests, utilizing Google&#39;s places API to grab real world locations based on latitude and longidude, and using C++ to begin programming the application interface that interacts with the server. </p>
<p>It&#39;s an ongoing project so be sure to watch for it on the Play Store or App Store. If you send me an email I can even add you into the select group of alpha testers!</p>
