					<div class="question" ><b>What's Your Name?</b></div>
					<div class="answer" ><img src="images/officiallyLighthearted.png" style="float:left"></img> Hi, I'm Garret Meier, a freshman in Software Engineering at Iowa State University who is minoring in Philosophy. 
						Check out my <a href="/files/Resume.pdf">resume</a> to learn a little more basic information about me.</div>

					<div class="question" ><b>Why choose Software Engineering?</b></div>
					<div class="answer" ><img src="images/homePic1.jpg" style="float:right;width:200px"></img> I first fell in love with computers after playing my first game of Age of Empires II, and my interest only deepened
						after I truly learned what programming and software development entailed. Since I enjoy both software development
						and the actual coding behind it, I chose Software Engineering as my major to learn the techniques behind both. 
						The S E program additionally offers the opportunity to see a holistic picture of technology including both software and hardware.</div>

					<div class="question" ><b>What is your programming experience?</b></div>
					<div class="answer" >My first programming experience was in High School with a language called Blitz Basic for three years. Towards
						<img src="images/homePic3.jpg" style="float:left;width:320px"></img>the end of my junior year in High School, I began learning Java. I then completed two semesters of college 
						classes specifically in Java. One taught the basics and the second taught differing design patterns in Java
						programs. I am currently taking a Design Patterns class in Java and have over a year and a half experience in
						the language. I also took a class in C programming in Fall 2013. Additionally, I have approximately six months
						experience in HTML, Python, and CSS which I have been teaching myself in my free time.</div>

					<div class="question" ><b>What do you want to do in technology?</b></div>
					<div class="answer" ><b></b>The most general answer I have about my goals in technology is that I am looking to innovate in any way I can. The
						ability to completely change the perception of a technology drew me into the field in the first place and I am<img src="images/homePic2.jpg" style="float:right;width:320px"></img> 
						looking to push the edges of whichever area of programming I enter into. More specifically, I see myself in
						the role of someone who interfaces with both the clients and programmers to achieve the best final product. The 
						times I enjoy myself the most are the early developmental stages where the group throws ideas onto a whiteboard
						and everyone collaborates to make the best final product. Following the evolution of a project from it's inception
						to actually hashing out a UML diagram of the specifications stands out as one of my favorite feelings. I enjoy it 
						so much that sometimes I just come up with an idea and try to flesh it out just for the fun of it.</div>

					<div class="question"><b>How do you stay busy outside of school?</b></div>
					<div class="answer" ><img src="images/homePic4.jpg" style="float:right;width:320px"></img>With so many opportunities to express myself outside of school whether through clubs or anything else, it proves
						continually difficult to choose how I invest my time. I like to stay busy with a variety of clubs and activities
						though. Related to my major I spend a lot of time practicing my problem solving skills with the ACM Programming
						competition team, the Computer Science and Software Engineering Club, hackathons, and Freshman Leaders in 
						Engineering. Outside of that I am a part of the Quidditch club on campus, I play intramural sports whenever the
						opportunity arises, and actively participate in the Iowa State Honors Program. Away from organized activities, I
						am a huge fan of bouldering, running, playing board games, attending concerts, and discussing politics. If you're
						interested in seeing a few of my favorite things, check out my favorites page!</div>

					<div class="question" ><b>Why are you minoring in Philosophy?</b></div>
					<div class="answer" >I chose to minor in Philosophy for two reasons. The first is that I am interested in learning about the canonical
						philosophical teachings, and the second is that I want to keep myself rounded in my interests. I enjoy the<img src="images/theLongWalk.jpg" style="float:right;width:320px"></img>
						reflective and introspective nature of philosophy, which questions the reasoning behind individual beliefs and 
						actions. Staying well-rounded as a person is a primary goal of mine which I believe taking philosophy classes
						will help achieve. I enjoy reading, writing, and communication and don't want to lose that while studying Software
						Engineering. I think it will help me to avoid becoming burned out as many programmers are.</div>
