<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Iowa State University hosted a Money Game Jam in the Spring of 2014, where teams were tasked with creating a game that would encourage college students to save more and reduce their student debt.</p>
<p>My team decided to take inspiration from popular time-wasting apps based on consistently collecting points (see, <a href="http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/" target="_blank">Cookie Clicker</a>). The user enters their bugeted earnings and spending over time, and the app would keep track of their overall buget.</p>
<p><em>In 24 hours, we weren&#39;t able to completely finish the project, but our idea managed to win third place overall.</em></p>
