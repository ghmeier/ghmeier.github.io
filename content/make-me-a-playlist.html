<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In the cold of winter, I got tired of making new plalists by hand, so naturally, I created a web interface for making new playlists. Just select one of your playlists as the base, and create something new based off of it. I built it in an afternoon with some plain ol' JS and a little Handlebars to spice it up.</p>
<p>Now my only problem is having too much new music to listen to.</p>
