<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Created in 24 hours by a team of three, Happy Little Cloud is the result of a hackathon with the theme of influencing people. With this theme, the team decided to create a simple game depicting the story of a rain drop looking to make a difference to a town in peril. To interface with the kinect, we utilized software which read kinect movements and responded with keypresses. This software, called FAAST is found here.</p>
<p><em>Feel free to download the source code. There is an executable .jar file there that should run the game for you.</em></p>
