<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>My first large scale project, Lost Hope is a 2d sandbox game telling the tale of a postapocalyptic world and a main character looking to regain the lost knowledge of the previous civilization.</p>
<p>While working on this project, I spent most of my time developing the world generation library. It was a great exercise in classic Object Oriented programming as well as mathematic derivation of formulas. To determine the size, shape and placement of various blocks in the game world, I devised calculations with random input that scaled and shifted with the worlds background caracteristics. </p>
<p><em>As of now, the project sits incomplete, but hopefully the time will come when it can be released.</em></p>
