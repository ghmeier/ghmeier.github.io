<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>For Iowa State's premier hackathon, HackISU, in Spring 2014, my team and I decided to utilize the Venmo API to create a web page which would serve as a social experiment.</p>
<p>Inspired by the concept of a wishing well, where passerbys throw money into a public space without even the thought of stealing it, we decided to create an online wishing well. Users have the ability to both throw money into the well and grab out a piece of &#39;change.&#39; </p>
<p>On this web app I focused on both the high level design and front-end design of the website. I also worked closely with the Venmo API to log in and send requests. </p>
<p><em>The demo app has functionality turned off so don&#39;t worry about accidentally spending money.</em></p>
