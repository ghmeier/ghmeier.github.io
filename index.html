			<p align="justify">
				As I'm leaving college and entering my career, I'm looking to gain as much experience as quickly as possible. In my first job out of school, at Mixmax, I'm hoping to work on valuable projects with lots of responsibility. Through my time at ISU, I've spent lots of time leading teams and executing on large scale project, so I'd like to continue along that path as I begin my career as a Software Engineer. Specific areas I'd like to explore are in back end systems and operations, building developer APIs and doing dev evangelism, and leading teams on larger projects. There are so many great areas of Software Engineering, that I'd like to explore and see which ones I enjoy most.

				From when I started at Iowa State in 2013 to now, my long term goals have been fulfilled in some ways and changed in others. I've been able to fulfill many of my goals of gaining new experiences both inside and outside of my coursework. My goals around helping and mentoring people have stayed very similar. The most meaningful work and working environments in my mind aren't about making the most money with the least effort, but about helping people and learning. Fulfillment, in my eyes stems from finding meaning, challenge, and worth in the work that I do. In the next years I see that manifesting in the choice of the places where I seek employment and the ways I interact with my coworkers. I'd like to contribute to a project with amazing people who are helping to improve the lives of others in meaningful ways. If not through the direct technology they create, then through contributing back to a community.

				Applications
				During my time at Iowa State, I made a concerted effort to take meaningful and intellectually challenging electives which didn’t have direct applications to my major in Software Engineering I took nearly enough classes to minor in Philosophy, some seminars on Feminism, and even one on the interplay between religion and media in the history of the United States. For me, these courses provided two primary benefits. They gave me a reason to read and write in a non-technical context, and they broadened my breadth of knowledge. First, I really enjoyed having at least three credits of interesting non-technical coursework each semester to get my mind out of mathematics and algorithms for a few hours each week. These gave me time to reflect on the intellectual subject of the course as well as my own interests outside of Software Engineering. Through my courses on Philosophy, I was able to develop critical thinking, and argumentation skills that I wouldn’t have even thought of otherwise. I’ve been exposed to classic arguments about ethics and meaning in life, and have been given the tools to continue exploring philosophy for more understanding as I leave college. My courses in Feminism have helped deepen my knowledge of Feminism and influenced my own identification as a feminist. In a broader sense, these courses helped teach me how to empathize with people and try and advocate for diversity and inclusion in all stages of my life.
			</p>
			<p align="justify">
				Specifically, I think my combined elective coursework has helped me better communicate and lead teams of individuals. I’ve taken tips from my English course on resolving group conflict, my Philosophy course on motivating people, and my Gender Studies courses on inclusion. All of these skills together have helped me become a more rounded individual in both thought and action.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For senior design, my group proposed Expresso, and automated, local, coffee subscription service. We’ve decided to build pursue Expresso for our senior design project because it presents interesting technical challenges, opportunities for learning new software engineering concepts, and the ability to influence people positively. Since Expresso aims to automate the process of ordering and shipping at every point except actually sending the packages, we have to build a reliable logistics systems for consumers and providers. We’ll be relying on partnering with local roasters to produce coffee for subscribers which creates a multiple stakeholders to please with the system, adding another layer of technicality. As a group, we wanted to grapple with a new challenge that wasn’t a part of our previous coursework, so we decided to build Expresso with a distributed, microservice architecture to give us experience designing a common software architecture from the ground up.
		</p>
		<p align="justify">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Expresso helps local coffee roasters scale their business more quickly and cost effectively than they could otherwise. By giving local roasters the opportunity to use Expresso as a shipping platform rather than having to build their own or contract it out, we’ve freed up roasters to do what they do best, roast coffee. Given that these roasters are oftentimes local businesses, committed to community growth, we think this service can have a positive impact on local businesses at the heart of their communities.

				<h2>Hackathon Planning Guide, Spring 2016</h2>
				<h4>English 314</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>The Hackathon planning guide I created during English last year provides detailed and specific instructions for running a hackathon at Iowa State. The guide includes everything from pro tips at dealing with University policies to how to contact sponsors. Created with the aim of encouraging other ISU clubs to run their own hack nights, this guide serves to keep information available for technical organizations to access. We used resources on Github to host the project, and Iowa State’s web resources to verify and inform our content.</li>
					<li><strong>Learning Outcomes&nbsp;</strong>This project helped me learn more about collaboration with a team on written documents, and distil learning into easily understandable instructions. I spent quite a lot of time trying to phrase this technical knowledge in an understandable and digestable manner for someone unfamiliar with the subject.</li>

					<li>Evaluate serves as a platform for students to anonymously and openly review their courses and professors. With courses taken from Iowa State’s catalogue, and reviews stored online, users can talk about their experiences, tips, and tricks for coursework at ISU. This project used some outside resources for Backbone.js and required reverse engineering the Iowa State class listing API.</li>

				<h4>Software Engineering 319</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Roguelike is a game, build in both C and C++ with some linking between them that I built as a semester-long project for CS 327.  As part of the requirements for the course, the game runs with no warnings, and no memory leaks (other than some unavoidable leakage from using NCURSES). This project focused on advanced programming concepts like memory management, graph traversal, and working in a large code base.</li>
					<li><strong>Learning Outcomes&nbsp;</strong>This game in C vastly improved my understanding of memory management, garbage collection, and object references. It has since proved invaluable to me when working in langauges which require specific access of references, like Golang</li

				<h2>Roguelike, Fall 2015</h2>
				<h4>Computer Science 327</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Core Link, a procedurally generated, clicker game, has a far more interesting back end than front by design. On the front end, it looks like any other incremental game with lots of buttons, and slowly accumulating resources, but behind the scenes, the program continuously generates a network of planets connected to each other. Allowing for many many players at the same time, this game constantly changes as you play it.</li>
					<li><strong>Learning Outcomes&nbsp;</strong>This project was a great study in dynamic updating and concurrent modification. Since there are potentially many clients modifying the same data concurrently, I was able to think about and impliment solutions to potential problems.</li>

				<h2>Boardem, Spring 2015</h2>
				<h4>Computer Science 309</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Boardem was a great team effort as a semester long project. The app allows users to schedule meetings for playing board games and have others join. More than the rough implementation, this game shows a bit of high quality touch which we had time for in the long project scope. For this project, we focused on the design and requirements process in addition to just the implementation. As a team, we coordinated through consistent progress reports and individual assigned tasks to ensure consistent progress.</li>
					<li><strong>Learning Outcomes&nbsp;</strong> I learned a lot about managing a group of people towards a common goal, task creation, and requirements generation on this project. Since I was team lead, I had to ensure we met and exceeded deadlines for our project as well as ensuring that the work was well defined and distributed equally throughout all team members</li>

			<h1 id="reflect">Software Engineering Reflection</h1>
			<p align="justify">
				I made my choice to attend Iowa State in part due to the presence of a Software Engineering program. I specifically wanted to learn the skills of applying knowledge of software systems to practical, real world problems. After spending four years in the SE program at ISU, I've learned many of the basic principles of both Computer Science and Software Engineering. Without the formal learning in courses at ISU, I would be far less prepared to tackle the tough problems when designing complicated software processes and systems. Specifically, the wide range of assignments, from individual, focused projects to larger, group oriented systems, gave me great experience in building those sorts of systems in a professional setting. My time at internships and working on side projects has been most beneficial to formulate and solve real engineering problems. This year, I've been building open source registration software for hackathons since I saw a real need, and knew how to scope the problem and build a useable solution. While the software engineering coursework didn't directly contribute to understanding engineering in a global context, my general education and personal interest definitely put the engineering work I'll be doing in perspective. At a more fundamental level, the use of groups in ISU's SE curriculum gave me great experience in coordinating and managing a team of people. As team lead on many of my projects, I was able to get a taste of what being a more senior engineer professionally would feel like and what sort of responsibilities it would entail.
			</p>
			<p align="justify">
				If I were to re-structure my undergraduate experience and take it again, I wouldn't take different courses that are currently available, but I would hope that the courses I did take which focused on project management and system design were more current and well structured. I felt like those courses were most lacking in the curriculum, and I was forced to do much of my learning outside class and on the job rather than having a base of fundamental learning from coursework.
