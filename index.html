                From when I started at Iowa State in 2013 to now, my long term goals have been fulfilled in some ways and changed in others. I’ve been able to fulfil many of my goals of gaining new experiences both inside and outside of my coursework. My goals around helping and mentoring people have stayed very similar. The most meaningful work and working environments in my mind aren’t about making the most money with the least effort, but about helping people and learning. Fulfillment, in my eyes stems from finding meaning, challenge, and worth in the work that I do. In the next years I see that manifesting in the choice of the places where I seek employment and the ways I interact with my coworkers. I’d like to contribute to a project with amazing people who are helping to improve the lives of others in meaningful ways. If not through the direct technology they create, then through contributing back to a community.

            <p align="justify">
                Applications
                During my time at Iowa State, I made a concerted effort to take meaningful and intellectually challenging electives which didn’t have direct applications to my major in Software Engineering I took nearly enough classes to minor in Philosophy, some seminars on Feminism, and even one on the interplay between religion and media in the history of the United States. For me, these courses provided two primary benefits. They gave me a reason to read and write in a non-technical context, and they broadened my breadth of knowledge. First, I really enjoyed having at least three credits of interesting non-technical coursework each semester to get my mind out of mathematics and algorithms for a few hours each week. These gave me time to reflect on the intellectual subject of the course as well as my own interests outside of Software Engineering. Through my courses on Philosophy, I was able to develop critical thinking, and argumentation skills that I wouldn’t have even thought of otherwise. I’ve been exposed to classic arguments about ethics and meaning in life, and have been given the tools to continue exploring philosophy for more understanding as I leave college. My courses in Feminism have helped deepen my knowledge of Feminism and influenced my own identification as a feminist. In a broader sense, these courses helped teach me how to empathize with people and try and advocate for diversity and inclusion in all stages of my life.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
                Specifically, I think my combined elective coursework has helped me better communicate and lead teams of individuals. I’ve taken tips from my English course on resolving group conflict, my Philosophy course on motivating people, and my Gender Studies courses on inclusion. All of these skills together have helped me become a more rounded individual in both thought and action.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For senior design, my group proposed Expresso, and automated, local, coffee subscription service. We’ve decided to build pursue Expresso for our senior design project because it presents interesting technical challenges, opportunities for learning new software engineering concepts, and the ability to influence people positively. Since Expresso aims to automate the process of ordering and shipping at every point except actually sending the packages, we have to build a reliable logistics systems for consumers and providers. We’ll be relying on partnering with local roasters to produce coffee for subscribers which creates a multiple stakeholders to please with the system, adding another layer of technicality. As a group, we wanted to grapple with a new challenge that wasn’t a part of our previous coursework, so we decided to build Expresso with a distributed, microservice architecture to give us experience designing a common software architecture from the ground up.
	    </p>
	    <p align="justify">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Expresso helps local coffee roasters scale their business more quickly and cost effectively than they could otherwise. By giving local roasters the opportunity to use Expresso as a shipping platform rather than having to build their own or contract it out, we’ve freed up roasters to do what they do best, roast coffee. Given that these roasters are oftentimes local businesses, committed to community growth, we think this service can have a positive impact on local businesses at the heart of their communities.

The guide includes everything from pro tips at dealing with University policies to how to contact sponsors. Created with the aim of encouraging other ISU clubs to run their own hack nights, this guide serves to keep information available for technical organizations to access. We used resources on Github to host the project, and Iowa State’s web resources to verify and inform our content.</li>
