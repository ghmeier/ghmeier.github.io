					<div class="question" ><b>Lost Hope</b></div>
					<div class="answer" ><b></b>Lost Hope is a project dreamt up by the members of Square Infinity, a company of which I am a founding partner.<img src="images/lostHopeTitle.jpg" style="width:200px;float:right"></img> 
						The game, taking elements from <a href="www.minecraft.net">Minecraft</a> and <a href="www.terraria.org">Terarria</a>, seeks to take the limitless, sandbox experience and add elements of story while pumping in an even greater 
						array of creativity than other games of the genre. As part of this project, I worked solely on one of the larger classes which controlled the random 
						<img src="images/LostHopeScreen3.png" style="float:left;width:200px;"></img>generation of the world. I created a class system which created a four-sided, square world randomly populated with dirt, stone, caves, ore, and more.
						Along with this, I created a class hierarchy for the various animals populating the world of Lost Hope. This meant working with some basic AI and a modification
						of the decorator design pattern.</div>

						the status of UT's iconic tower. My role on this project was to create a system in Java to parse information from external XML file as well as write to that file.

					<div class="question"><b>Othello</b></div>
					<div class="answer"><img src="images/othello.png" style="width:200px;float:left"></img>In my rendition of the classic strategy game, I utilized the model-view-controller design pattern to create a playable Othello game with an AI 
					which is unassumingly tough to defeat.

					<div class="question"><b>Programming Challenges</b></div>
					<div class="answer">One of my more small scale programming hobbies is finding and completing programming challenges. From Project Euler to the ACM competition team,
					I really enjoy wrapping my head around a new logical problem often. When I'm not working on a prototype project,<img src="http://iwanttolearnruby.com/images/project-euler.png" style="float:right;width:200"></img> I like to find small problems which I can tackle in
					an hour or two. Through this, I've discovered a little bit about optimization, memoization, and algorithms even though I haven't taken any formal classes covering those
					topics.

					<div class="question"><b>Character Generator</b></div>
					<div class="answer"> <img src="images/characterGenerator.png" style="width:270px;float:left"></img>After becoming curious about parsing languages, I am working on creating my own file-type to test out the idea and see what all I can accomplish 
					with this. The project vehicle I'm using to try out the waters is a character generator for Dungeons and Dragons. Combining a few of my interests, I am looking forward
					to trying out the potential of a parsable file-type.

					<div class="question"><b>The Fable Of Zelma</b></div>
					<div class="answer">Through Professor Joseph Zambreno on the Iowa State campus, I am working on a team to create a game for the annual <a href="http://www.rcl.ece.iastate.edu/educational/video-game-scripting">Iowa State IT Olympics</a>. The IT Olympics
					is a day where high school students from around the state of Iowa gather on the Iowa State campus and compete in various Information Technology-centric events. The game
					<img src="images/MockRooms.jpg" style="width:220px;float:left"></img>I am working on serves as the centerpiece for the programming portion of the IT Olympics. The mechanics of this game are geared to provide the competing students with a
					basic programming experience through running scripts which control their character in-game. So, the team and I will be creating the basic game engine and provide 
					capability for running scripts which the students will then utilize during the IT Olympics competition.

					<div class="question"><b>PlanIt</b></div>
					<div class="answer">An ongoing project to <img src="images/planItScreen.png" style="width:250px;float:right"></img>create a more usable planning interface, I'm working to make a task planner which utilizes the familiar mobile home screen 
					layout to organize data in a format differing form from the traditionally linear to-do list. I'm working through this while familiarizing myself with the Java Swing 
					package and its capabilities. It's still in prototype form, but progress is continually being made.

					<div class="answer">
						In addition to programming, I also have a blog and enjoy myself through writing. I like to write on a variety of subjects from "4 Reasons to own a Chromebook," to why I really
						like cloud watching. Check it out <a href="https://medium.com/@headin_thecloud">here!</a>
