<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Every year Iowa State hosts something called the <a href="http://www.it-adventures.org/it-olympics/" target="_blank">IT Olympics</a> on its campus in the Spring. This event covers areas from robotics to basic programming. These events are designed to help middle and high school students get a taste of both hardware and software. </p>
<p>As a part of this, Professor Zambreno has worked in the past to create scripting engines used to control a video game. There have been a few <a href="http://www.rcl.ece.iastate.edu/educational/video-game-scripting" target="_blank">previous iterations</a>, and Fable of Zelma is the version slated to appear this coming Spring. </p>
<p>I began work as part of an undergraduate team in the Spring 2014 semester, but when the rest of the team became busy over the summer, I took over as the sole developer. </p>
<p>Throughout the project, I&#39;ve learned a great deal about OpenGL graphics, string parsing, and C++ conventions. </p>
