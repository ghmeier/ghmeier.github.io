<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>As part of a software development class at Iowa State, my team and I build a web-app for creating meetups for board games. Throughout the process we focused not only on building a polished final product, but also on having a solid development process and working as a team. For our efforts we were voted as one of the top 7 projects in the class by the professor and teaching assistants. Built with a webapp front end and a server back end, we were able to keep the processing and display of information separate as well as create a fully functional REST api for the back end.</p>
<p>On this project, I took on the role of project manager and front end developer. Managing our Trello board with work tickets and ensuring that the team continued completing tasks. As a result we were able to complete our project with very little stress since the work was spread out evenly throughout the semester rather than procrastinating as is that habit of students taking that class. </p>
